        <h4>Out of stock Items</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Should any the items in your order be out of stock (on larger orders)
          you will receive a full refund unless the order is over 70% complete.
          This means that we will still ship the remaining items.
        </p>

        <h4>What are your delivery times</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Candy Kabin will normally dispatch orders within 3-5 working days from
          order completion (sometimes sooner).
          <br />
          <br />
          From time to time there may be an issue with an order. Should any
          issues arise we will be in contact with you to quickly to discuss
          options.

        <h4>What if I'm not home when it's delivered?</h4>
        <p>
          Our delivery companies will leave a calling card if they are unable to
          deliver a parcel, please follow the instructions on the calling card
          and contact your local depot to rearrange delivery/collection within 3
          working days. If arrangements for delivery are not completed in 3
          working days your parcel will be returned back to Candy Kabin; this
          may incur a further delivery charge.

        <h4>The order has arrived and I'm not 100% happy</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          We always aim to deliver the best possible service, but we are only
          human - if we missed something from the order or sent you a wrong
          item, please contact us directly where a member of the team can help.
          This will also be the same should your entire order or a part of it
          becomes damaged in transit.
        </p>
