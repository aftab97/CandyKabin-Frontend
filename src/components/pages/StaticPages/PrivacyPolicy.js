          The below Privacy Policy explains how personal information is

        <h4>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information
          about your device, including information about your web browser, IP
          address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your
          device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information
          about the individual web pages or products that you view, what
          websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information
          about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this
          automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          - “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer
          and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information
          about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
          http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          - “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data
          including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider,
          referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          - “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to
          record information about how you browse the Site.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase
          through the Site, we collect certain information from you, including
          your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information,
          email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as
          “Order Information.”
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we
          are talking both about Device Information and Order Information
        </p>
        <br />

          information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices
          and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order
          Information to:

        <p>
          We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for
          potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more
          generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating
          analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site,
          and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
        <br />

          otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>DATA RETENTION</h4>
        <br />
        <p>

          information
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>CREDIT CARD SECURITY</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          We use a secure order system with one of the leading companies in the
          field, Barclays. Your credit card details are encrypted with Barclays
          on their secure server to protect you from fraud. We do not receive or
          store your credit card details, only the confirmation that the
          transaction has been made.

        <br />
