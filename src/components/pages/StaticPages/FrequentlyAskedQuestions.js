          traditional method of weighing out sweets! This half a pound in small
          Imperial units = 8 ounces. In metric terms, half a pound is

          monitor, update and improve our website software which is stored on

          secure which is an online version of chip and pin. This adds an extra
          level of protection for your card. Please see below for further
          information.

          do to use Master Card Secure Code is place an order with us and follow
          the instructions. Alternatively, you may contact the card company who
          issued your card to apply. Please note this is a free service offered

        <h4>Can I change or amend my order after it has been placed?</h4>
        <p>
          While we will certainly do our best for our customers, sometimes it
          may not be possible. Firstly it is important that you always make sure
          your order is correct before placing. Should an order still be being
          processed and has not been dispatched we can normally accommodate for
          minor changes.
          <br />
          <br />
          If an order has been dispatched it is out of our hands and nothing can
          be done. We process orders quickly so get in contact ASAP via Contact
          us – with your order number.
